# Dolphin-Explorer 
Dolphin Mini game made using RAGE 

You must have rage installed and configured. Then, just compile all java files and run myGame class in a1 package.

__How the game is played__

In the beginning of the game, you are spawned behind the dolphin, not riding it. Press 	space to ride the dolphin. The game will not let you stray far from the dolphin itself. It 	will respawn you near the dolphin should you try to escape. You can ride the dolphin and 	visit planets, but you need to be off the dolphin inorder to do so. Once you get of the 	dolphin, you can run into the planet and your score will increment. But there is a catch. 	You have limited energy. If you run out of energy, then game over. To regain all your 	energy, simply ride your dolphin to the pyramid base, then get off and run into it to be 	replenished.
